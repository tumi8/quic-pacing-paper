# QUIC Interop Runner with hardware support  

The Interop Test Runner aims to automatically generate an interop matrix by running multiple **test cases** using different QUIC implementations.
Note, this runner is an adaptation of the [original implementation](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner).
Instead of relying on docker-compose and simulating a network, it executes the server and client from a management host on bare metal servers or locally.


## Requirements
The Interop Runner is written in Python 3. You'll need to install a few Python modules to run it. A virtual environment would be optimal, especially when installing it on a management host. 

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- `pos` python library with calendar support due to the setup scripts allocations. 

* The client is given URLs including a hostname. To be able to resolve this hostname, the /etc/hosts file has to be updated. The hostname is "server". The IP address has to be set to 127.0.0.1 in local mode and the server IP address in testbed mode.

- Optional: For several testcases which inspect packet traces you need to install development version of Wireshark (version 3.4.2 or newer). This is only feasable if you run this framework on your own hosts in local mode. The testbed management host (e.g. kaunas of the baltikum testbed) does not allow for root access.


## Example Usage
## Run locally
- make sure to point the DNS name `server` to `127.0.0.1`. See known issues
- do not use the `--testbed` flag as it executes the framework in remote mode

Example:
```bash
# Fetch the implementations to the folder `out`
python3 fetch_artifacts.py
# Execute locally, using the goodput test and the implementation quiche for client and server which we just fetched to `out`
python3 run.py -t goodput -i out -s quiche -c quiche
```
### Run in testbed mode
After installing the requirements:
```bash
# Boot and configure testbed hosts
./setup-hosts.sh testbed/testbed_cesis-nida.json

# Copy your implementations over and set the path to it in implementations.json

# Measure Goodput 
python3 run.py -t goodput --testbed testbed_cesis_nida.json
# Measure Goodput with a 100 Mbps bandwidth limit set with tc
python3 run.py -t goodput --testbed testbed_cesis_nida.json --bandwidth 100mbit
```

Note that the `setup-hosts.sh` script also supports some options:
- `-dpdk`: installs and sets up DPDK on client and server
- `-drivers`: installs specific NIC drivers (as specified in the testbed config file); this may be needed on some hosts when the OS version is too old (e.g., Intel E810 NICs on Debian 11)
```bash
# Boot and configure testbed hosts and install drivers
./setup-hosts.sh testbed/testbed_goracle-gard.json -drivers
```

### Using Pre-/Postscripts for Server and Client
You can run your own custom scripts right before client and server execution,
aswell as after the transfer. This way you can add your own functionality
to the measurement framework, which makes it very flexible. 
All test relevant iteration variables like the log folder or the interface used
can be accessed using pos with `pos_get_var --remote <VARIABLE>`. 
The help command shows available variables for server and client scripts. 
Examples can be seen in the `pre-post-scripts` folder, which e.g., features a 
way to disable NIC offloading for the measurement.

Example:
```bash
# run with pre/postscripts that
# 1) deactivate all NIC offloading
# 2) start capture of CPU util using pidstat
# on both server and client.
python3 run.py -t goodput -i out -s quiche -c quiche --testbed $TESTBED \                                                        
-spre pre-post-scripts/start-pidstat.sh,pre-post-scripts/deactivate-nic-offload.sh \
-spost pre-post-scripts/stop-pidstat.sh,pre-post-scripts/activate-nic-offload.sh \
-cpre pre-post-scripts/start-pidstat.sh,pre-post-scripts/deactivate-nic-offload.sh \
-cpost pre-post-scripts/stop-pidstat.sh,pre-post-scripts/activate-nic-offload.sh
```

## Known issues
- running locally requires an `/etc/hosts` entry that points the DNS name `server` to loopback `127.0.0.1` instead of a remote address. This DNS name is used in the client request 


## Building a QUIC endpoint

To include your QUIC implementations in the Interop Runner, three scripts are required:
* setup-env.sh
* run-client.sh
* run-server.sh

Typically, a test case will require a server to serve files from a directory, and a client to download files. Different test cases will specify the behavior to be tested. For example, the Retry test case expects  the server to use a Retry before accepting the connection from the client.
All configuration information from the test framework to your implementation is fed to the scripts run-client.sh and run-server.sh.
You can use them in your respective implementations as enviorenment variables or use the script to transform them into command line parameters.

The test case is passed into your Docker container using the `TESTCASE` environment variable. If your implementation doesn't support a test case, it MUST exit with status code 127. This will allow us to add new test cases in the future, and correctly report test failures und successes, even if some implementations have not yet implented support for this new test case.

After the transfer is completed, the client container is expected to exit with exit status 0. If an error occurred during the transfer, the client is expected to exit with exit status 1.
After completion of the test case, the Interop Runner will verify that the client downloaded the files it was expected to transfer, and that the file contents match. Additionally, for certain test cases, the      Interop Runner will use the pcap of the transfer to verify that the implementations fulfilled the requirements of the test (for example, for the Retry test case, the pcap should show that a Retry packet was sent, and that the client used the Token provided in that packet).

### Server Variables
The following variables will be given to the server and should be supported by your implementation
| Var | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| SSLKEYLOGFILE | The variable contains the path + name of the keylog file. The output is required to decrypt traces and verify tests. The file has to be in the [NSS Key Log format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format) |
| QLOGDIR | qlog results are not required but might help to debug your output. However they have a negativ impact on performance so you might want to deactivate it for some tests|
| LOGS | The directory name to write general logs to|
| TESTCASE | The name of the testcase |
| WWW | This directory will contain one or more randomly generated files. Your server implementation is expected to run on the given port 443 and serve files from this directory. |
| CERTS | The certs created to be used by the server during the handshake. The server needs to load its private key from `priv.key`, and the certificate chain from `cert.pem`. |
| IP | The IP the server should listen on |
| PORT | The port the server should listen on |
| SERVERNAME | The servername a client might send using SNI. The name relates to the provided certificate and might be necessary for some QUIC implementations. |

### Client Variables
The following variables will be given to the server and should be supported by your implementation
| Var | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| SSLKEYLOGFILE | The variable contains the path + name of the keylog file. The output is required to decrypt traces and verify tests. The file has to be in the [NSS Key Log format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format). |
|QLOGDIR| qlog results are not required but might help to debug your output. However they have a negativ impact on performance so you might want to deactivate it for some tests |
|LOGS|The directory name to write general logs to |
| TESTCASE | The name of the testcase |
|DOWNLOADS| The directory is initially empty, and your client implementation is expected to store downloaded files into this directory. Served and downloaded files are compared to check the test. |
| REQUESTS | A space seperated list of requests a client should execute one by one. (e.g., https://server:4433/xyz) |

### implementations.json
The implementations.json file contains a simple json with an object for each implementation.
Implementations as simply represented as a named object with a path variable.
The path should point to the folder containing the three required scripts.
Scripsts themselves should be able to execute at any location. Paths inside scripts (e.g., to your binaries) should be relative to the script.

### Logs

To facilitate debugging, the Interop Runner saves the log files to the logs directory.

Implementations that implement [qlog](https://github.com/quiclog/internet-drafts) should export the log files to the directory specified by the `QLOGDIR` environment variable.

## Test cases

The Interop Runner implements the following test cases. Unless noted otherwise, test cases use HTTP/3 for file transfers. More test cases will be added in the future, to test more protocol features. The name in parentheses is the value of the `TESTCASE` environment variable passed into your Docker container.

* **Handshake** (`handshake`):
The client requests a single file and the server should serve the file. The test
is successful if there is exactly one QUIC handshake and no retries within the
packet trace. Additionally, the downloaded file must be equal to the file served
by the server.

* **Transfer** (`transfer`):
The client needs to send multiple requests and download all files using a single
connection. All files have to match and only a single handshake should be visible
to pass the test.

* **Multi Handshake** (`multihandshake`):
The client needs to send multiple requests and download all files using new
connections for each request. All files have to match and for each file, a
handshake needs to be visible to pass the test.

* **Version Negotiation** (`versionnegotiation`):
Tests whether a server sends a valid version negotiation packet in response to
an unknown QUIC version number. The client should start a connection using an
unsupported version number (it can use a reserved version number to do so), and
has to abort the connection attempt when receiving the Version Negotiation packet.

* **Transport Parameter** (`transportparameter`):
Tests whether the server is able to set an initial_max_streams_bidi value of < 11
during the handshake. The client has to download all files with a single connection.

* **Follow** (`follow`):
The client requests a single file from the server, which serves two files. While the
first file contains the path of the second file, the second file contains random data.
The client only receives one request but has to download both files by parsing the
content of the first file and constructing a second request by replacing the path with
the one retrieved.

* **ChaCha20** (`chacha20`):
In this test, client and server are expected to offer only
`TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` as a cipher suite. The client then downloads the files.

* **Retry** (`retry`):
Tests that the server can generate a Retry, and that the client can act upon it
(i.e. use the Token provided in the Retry packet in the Initial packet). Only a
single handshake should be visible.

* **Resumption** (`resumption`):
Tests QUIC session resumption (**without** 0-RTT). The client is expected to establish
a connection and download the first file (first value in the REQUESTS variable).
The server is expected to provide the client with a session ticket that allows it
to resume the connection. After downloading the first file, the client has to close
the first connection, establish a resumed connection using the session ticket, and
use this connection to download the remaining file(s).

* **0-RTT** (`zerortt`):
Tests QUIC 0-RTT. The client is expected to establish a connection and download the
first file. The server is expected to provide the client with a session ticket that
allows the client to establish a 0-RTT connection on the next connection attempt.
After downloading the first file, the client has to close the first connection,
establish and request the remaining file(s) in 0-RTT.

* **Multiplexing** (`multiplexing`):
Tests whether the server is able to set an `initial_max_streams_bidi` value of < 11
during the handshake. The client has to download all files with a single connection.
